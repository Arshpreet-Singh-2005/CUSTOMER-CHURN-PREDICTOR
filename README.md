# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction System

## 🔍 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by subscription-based and service-driven businesses.  
This project builds an **end-to-end Machine Learning system** that predicts whether a customer is likely to **churn (leave the service)** based on historical data.

The goal is not just prediction accuracy, but also **business insight** — identifying key factors that influence churn so companies can take proactive retention actions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Acquiring a new customer is significantly more expensive than retaining an existing one.  
By predicting churn in advance, businesses can:
- Identify high-risk customers
- Offer targeted discounts or engagement strategies
- Reduce revenue loss

This project solves this problem using **supervised machine learning**.

## 🧠 Solution Approach
The project follows a **complete ML lifecycle**:

1. Data Collection & Understanding  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
4. Feature Engineering  
5. Model Training & Comparison  
6. Model Evaluation  
7. Model Saving for Deployment

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer information such as:
- Demographics
- Service usage patterns
- Subscription details
- Payment behavior

**Target Variable**
- `Churn` →  
  - `1` : Customer will churn  
  - `0` : Customer will stay  

---

## 🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to:
- Understand churn distribution
- Identify correlations between features
- Detect class imbalance
- Extract business insights

📌 **Key Insights**
- Customers with shorter tenure have higher churn probability
- Certain service plans show higher churn rates
- Monthly contract users churn more than long-term contracts

---

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering
Key preprocessing steps:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Removing redundant features

Feature engineering helped improve **model performance and stability**.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
Multiple models were trained and compared:

| Model | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Logistic Regression | Baseline & interpretability |
| Random Forest | Non-linear feature interactions |
| Gradient Boosting | Improved performance |

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

📌 **Best Model**
The final selected model achieved strong performance while maintaining interpretability.

---

## 💾 Model Persistence
The trained model is saved using `pickle` so it can be:
- Reused without retraining
- Integrated into a web application or API
- Deployed in production

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add a **web interface** using Streamlit or Flask
- Deploy the model as a **REST API**
- Integrate **Explainable AI (SHAP / LIME)**
- Add real-time prediction support
- Implement CI/CD for ML pipeline
